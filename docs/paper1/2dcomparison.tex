%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\em Introduction.}---We study things about porous flow.  Need to
discuss
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stokes assumption (small Reynold's number)
  \item 2D assumption
  \item Working with primitive variable instead of a homogenization such
  as Darcy's Law.
  \item Lagrangian coherent structures.
\end{itemize}

\caption{\label{f:beans} This geometry, which we call the {\em circle
geometry}, consists of 465 circular exclusions and has a porosity (the
ratio of the region that contains the fluid) of 0.46.  The outer wall
is denoted by $\Gamma_{0}$, and the boundary of the inner exclusions by
$\Gamma_{k}$, $k=1,\ldots,465$.}

{\em Experimental setup.}---Pietro discuses the
\begin{itemize}
  \item Experimental design
  \item Paramters and main variables
  \item Experimental methodologies
  \item PIV
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\em Numerical solution.}---Here we discuss are method for numerically
solving the Stokes equations
\begin{align}
  \mu \Delta \uu  = \grad p, \qquad \grad \cdot \uu = 0,
  \label{e:stokes}
\end{align}
with the no-slip boundary condition $\uu = \ff$.  We use a boundary
integral equation since they naturally handle complex geometries, do
not suffer from ill-conditioning associated with direct discretizations
of~\eqref{e:stokes}, achieve high-order accuracy by using appropriate
quadrature formulae, analytically satisfy the incompressibility
condition, and are solved in linear time by coupling an iterative
solver and the fast multipole method (FMM).  Given a domain $\Omega$
with boundary $\Gamma$, and a target point $\xx \in \Omega \backslash
\Gamma$, the single- and double-layer potentials for Stokes equations
are~\cite{poz1992}
\begin{align*}
  \SS[\ssigma](\xx) &= \frac{1}{4\pi\mu}\int_{\Gamma} \left(
  -\log\rho I + \frac{\rr \otimes\rr}{\rho^{2}} 
  \right)\ssigma(\yy)ds_{\yy},  \\
  \DD[\ssigma](\xx) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\Gamma} 
  \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^{2}}\frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^{2}}
  \ssigma(\yy)ds_{\yy},
\end{align*}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$, $\rho = \|\rr\|$, and $\nn$ is the unit outward
normal of $\Gamma$.  In our porous geometry, we write $\uu$ as a
combination of single- and double-layer potentials
\begin{align}
  \uu(\xx) = \sum_{k=1}^{M} \SS[\ssigma_{k}](\xx) + 
    \DD[\ssigma_{0}](\xx).
  \label{e:integralRep}
\end{align}
The no-slip boundary condition is satisfied by solving 
\begin{align}
  \ff(\xx) = \sum_{k=1}^{M} \SS[\ssigma_{k}](\xx) + 
    \DD[\ssigma_{0}](\xx) + 
    \frac{1}{2}\left\{
    \begin{array}{cl}
      \ssigma(\xx) & \xx \in \Gamma_{0}, \\
      0 & \xx \in \Gamma \backslash \Gamma_{0},
    \end{array}
    \right.
    \label{e:integralEqn}
\end{align}
for $\ssigma$.

We use a Nystr\"{o}m method to discretize~\eqref{e:integralEqn}.  The
density function is discretized at a set of collocation points, and the
integrals are approximated with suitable quadrature rules.  A
high-order Gauss-Trapezoid rule~\cite{alp1999} discretizes $\SS$, and,
since the kernel of $\DD$ is smooth, the trapezoid rule is used to
discretize $\DD$.  The resulting linear system is solved iteratively
with GMRES~\cite{saa:sch1986}, and the matrix-vector multiplication is
computed with $\bigO(N)$ operations by using the FMM~\cite{cmcl2012}.
We use a block-diagonal preconditioner, where each $\Gamma_{k}$,
$k=0,\ldots,M$ corresponds to a block of the full linear system.  For
the circle geometry, the single-layer potential is known analytically
and can be applied efficiently with $\bigO(N \log N)$ operations with
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  The single-layer potential for the
bean geometry is precomputed and factorized as a dense matrix.

We iteratively solve~\eqref{e:integralEqn} with unpreconditioned GMRES
and a tolerance of $10^{-6}$ which requires 675 iterations for the
circular geometry, and 1,703 iterations for the bean geometry.  In both
cases, the outer boundary is discretized with $N = 2,048$ points, and
each inner geometry is discretized with $N = 256$ points.
Once~\eqref{e:integralEqn} is solved, the velocity $\uu$ can be
computed at any point $\xx \in \Omega$ by applying the trapezoid rule
to the representation formula~\eqref{e:integralRep}.  However, the
quality of the quadrature rule degrades as $\xx$ approaches $\Gamma$.
We use a near-singular integration strategy, first outlined
in~\cite{bir:yin:zor2004}, that guarantees a uniform quadrature error
across $\Omega$.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\em Results.}---We compare the flows in the two geometries.
Quantities of interest include (but are not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Point values of velocity field
  \item PDF of velocity in both directions
  \item Incompressibility
  \item Correlations of velocities
\end{itemize}

Now can use numerical solution to understand LCS


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\em Conclusions.}---Experimental and numerical results are in decent
agreement.  Incompressibility is satisfied to an acceptable level.  3D
effects are not important
